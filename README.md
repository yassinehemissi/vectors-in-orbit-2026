# Babyneers — Vectors in Orbit 2016

## Introduction

This repository documents our progress and final deliverables developed during the **Vectors in Orbit 2016** hackathon, hosted by **GDC SupCom x FST** and partnered with **Qdrant**.

Our work focuses on exploring vector databases and their applications in modern AI systems, information retrieval, and semantic search, in alignment with the hackathon’s core objectives.

## Pipeline (Short)

This project includes a document processing pipeline that converts PDFs/TEI into structured blocks, normalizes them into relational hblocks, generates section/paper summaries, and extracts experiments with evidence grounding. Outputs are stored in Astra (Cassandra) for full text and Qdrant for vector search.
